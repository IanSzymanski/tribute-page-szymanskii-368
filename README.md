# tribute-page-szymanskii-368
freeCodeCamp Tribute Page certification project.

Well here we are. I feel like this project was the first time that I felt good about what I was doing. I never felt "lost" before, in fact I enjoy helping other people out with their code. But I spent probably half the time on this project than I spent on the survey form, and I feel twice as proud of it. I'm not even finished with this class and I already want to take another. I also want to point out that I really just put in the freecodecamp id's after the fact just to check the box. So much of what I had done uses classes for reusability, and I didn't want to rewrite everything and have a bunch of redundancy because of that. So all of the id's that freecodecamp requires all do absolutely nothing. Also, why does it require an id for main? Main is a semantic element yo.
