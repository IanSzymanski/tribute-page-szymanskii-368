# tribute-page-szymanskii-368
freeCodeCamp Tribute Page certification project.

Well here we are. I feel like this project was the first time that I felt good about what I was doing. I never felt "lost" before, in fact I enjoy helping other people out with their code. But I spent probably half the time on this project than I spent on the survey form, and I feel twice as proud of it. I'm not even finished with this class and I already want to take another.
